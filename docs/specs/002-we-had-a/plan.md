# Implementation Plan: Complete Sorting Race Implementation

**Branch**: `002-we-had-a` | **Date**: 2025-01-13 | **Spec**: [spec.md](/home/ubuntu/algo-zoo/specs/002-we-had-a/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/ubuntu/algo-zoo/specs/002-we-had-a/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Complete the sorting race visualization tool by replacing all stub implementations with working code. The primary requirement is to fix the Quick Sort budget limitation that prevents it from running with k=16 on arrays >17 elements, implement complete TUI visualization components (bar charts, sparklines, memory graphs), and add missing fairness models (weighted, wall-time, adaptive). This builds upon the existing architecture with step-wise algorithm execution and budget-controlled fairness models. The previous implementation included comprehensive parallel development that already completed most features - this plan validates the current state and ensures all components are production-ready.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Rust 1.75+ with 2024 edition  
**Primary Dependencies**: ratatui 0.29.0 (TUI framework), crossterm 0.29.0 (terminal control), clap 4.5 (CLI parsing)  
**Storage**: N/A (in-memory array data only)  
**Testing**: cargo test with proptest for property-based testing, assert_cmd for CLI testing  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform terminal applications (Linux, macOS, Windows)
**Project Type**: single (command-line TUI application)  
**Performance Goals**: 25-35 FPS terminal rendering, sub-200ms step execution, handle 1000+ element arrays  
**Constraints**: Terminal-only interface, budget-constrained algorithm execution, deterministic with seeds  
**Scale/Scope**: Educational tool, 7 sorting algorithms, 4 fairness models, real-time visualization

**Arguments Integration**: The implementation was already completed through comprehensive parallel development including Quick Sort incremental partitioning fix, complete visualization system (BarChart, Sparkline, MemoryGraph, ProgressBar), four fairness models (comparison, weighted, wall-time, adaptive), and Shell Sort as 7th algorithm. All major components have been implemented with 56 passing tests and full TDD approach.

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)

└── [platform-specific structure]
```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy** (Validation-focused):
Since implementation is already complete, /tasks command will generate validation and polish tasks:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate validation tasks from quickstart.md test scenarios  
- Create performance benchmarking tasks
- Generate documentation review tasks
- Create final integration validation tasks

**Special Considerations for Complete Implementation**:
- Focus on VALIDATION rather than implementation tasks
- Verify contract compliance for all components
- Performance profiling and optimization identification
- Final quality assurance and polish tasks
- Documentation completeness verification

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Validation before optimization
- Contract verification before performance testing
- Documentation review before final signoff
- Mark [V] for validation tasks, [P] for performance tasks

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 validation/polish tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
