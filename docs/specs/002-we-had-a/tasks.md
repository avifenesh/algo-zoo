# Tasks: Complete Sorting Race Implementation

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/ubuntu/algo-zoo/specs/002-we-had-a/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), research.md (complete), data-model.md (complete), contracts/ (complete)
**Status**: VALIDATION-FOCUSED (Implementation already complete)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. ✅ Load plan.md from feature directory - FOUND
   → Extracted: Rust 1.75+, ratatui 0.29.0, crossterm 0.29.0, single TUI project
2. ✅ Load design documents:  
   → data-model.md: Extracted 5 core entities (Sorter, FairnessModel, Telemetry, etc.)
   → contracts/: Found 3 contract files (sorter, fairness, visualization)
   → research.md: Implementation validation complete - all features implemented
3. ✅ Generate validation and polish tasks (implementation complete)
4. ✅ Apply task rules: [V] = validation, [P] = performance/parallel, [D] = documentation
5. ✅ Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. ✅ Generate dependency graph for validation workflow
7. ✅ Create parallel execution examples for validation tasks
8. ✅ Validate task completeness: All contracts validated, all entities verified
9. ✅ SUCCESS - validation tasks ready for execution
```

## Format: `[ID] [V/P/D] Description`
- **[V]**: Validation task - verify implementation correctness
- **[P]**: Performance task - benchmarking and optimization  
- **[D]**: Documentation task - review and polish docs

## Phase 1: Contract Validation (Critical Path)
**CRITICAL: Verify all implementations comply with defined contracts**
- [ ] T001 [V] Validate Sorter contract compliance for all 7 algorithms in `/home/ubuntu/algo-zoo/src/services/sorters/`
- [ ] T002 [V] Validate FairnessModel contract compliance for all 4 models in `/home/ubuntu/algo-zoo/src/services/fairness/`
- [ ] T003 [V] Validate visualization contract compliance for all widgets in `/home/ubuntu/algo-zoo/src/lib/`
- [ ] T004 [V] Verify Quick Sort incremental partitioning works with k=16 budget on 50+ element arrays

## Phase 2: Integration Validation (Must complete after Phase 1)
- [ ] T005 [V] Execute quickstart Test 1 (Basic Functionality) with 7 algorithms visible
- [ ] T006 [V] Execute quickstart Test 2 (Fairness Models) verify all 4 models functional
- [ ] T007 [V] Execute quickstart Test 3 (Quick Sort Budget Fix) verify no hanging on large arrays
- [ ] T008 [V] Execute quickstart Test 4 (Visual Components) verify TUI rendering correctly

- [ ] T009 [V] Execute quickstart Test 5 (Performance) verify 25-35 FPS on large arrays

## Phase 3: Performance Validation (Parallel execution allowed)
- [ ] T010 [P] Benchmark sorting performance on 100, 500, 1000 element arrays
- [ ] T011 [P] Memory usage profiling - verify <50MB for largest arrays
- [ ] T012 [P] Frame rate measurement - confirm 25-35 FPS target met
- [ ] T013 [P] Budget allocation timing - verify fairness models perform within constraints
- [ ] T014 [P] Stress test all algorithms with various distributions (shuffled, reversed, nearly-sorted)

## Phase 4: Code Quality Validation (Parallel execution allowed)
- [ ] T015 [V] Run full test suite - verify all 56+ tests passing
- [ ] T016 [V] Code coverage analysis - ensure critical paths tested
- [ ] T017 [V] Linting and formatting check - cargo clippy and cargo fmt
- [ ] T018 [V] Documentation review - verify README.md reflects all implemented features

## Phase 5: User Experience Polish (Sequential)
- [ ] T019 [V] Interactive controls testing - verify space/r/q keys work correctly
- [ ] T020 [V] CLI parameter validation - test all fairness model parameters
- [ ] T021 [V] Edge case handling - test with size 2, 3, empty arrays
- [ ] T022 [V] Error handling validation - verify graceful degradation

## Phase 6: Final Validation (Must be last)
- [ ] T023 [V] End-to-end validation - complete race with all algorithms finishing correctly
- [ ] T024 [D] Final documentation update - ensure all features documented
- [ ] T025 [V] Production readiness checklist - verify no critical issues remain

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 (T001-T004) must complete before Phase 2
- Phase 2 (T005-T009) must complete before Phase 3  
- Phase 3-4 can run in parallel after Phase 2
- Phase 5 (T019-T022) requires Phase 3-4 completion
- Phase 6 (T023-T025) must be last

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3 Performance Tasks (can run together):
```bash
# Launch T010-T014 in parallel:
Task: "Benchmark sorting performance on 100, 500, 1000 element arrays"
Task: "Memory usage profiling - verify <50MB for largest arrays"  
Task: "Frame rate measurement - confirm 25-35 FPS target met"
Task: "Budget allocation timing - verify fairness models perform within constraints"
Task: "Stress test all algorithms with various distributions"
```

### Phase 4 Quality Tasks (can run together):
```bash
# Launch T015-T018 in parallel:
Task: "Run full test suite - verify all 56+ tests passing"
Task: "Code coverage analysis - ensure critical paths tested"
Task: "Linting and formatting check - cargo clippy and cargo fmt"  
Task: "Documentation review - verify README.md reflects all implemented features"
```

## Detailed Task Specifications

### T001: Sorter Contract Validation
**File Path**: `/home/ubuntu/algo-zoo/src/services/sorters/`
**Validation Criteria**:
- All 7 algorithms implement Sorter trait completely
- step() method respects budget constraints  
- is_complete() returns true only when array is sorted
- get_telemetry() provides accurate metrics
- reset() properly initializes state

### T004: Quick Sort Budget Fix Validation  
**File Path**: `/home/ubuntu/algo-zoo/src/services/sorters/quick.rs`
**Critical Test**: 
```bash
cargo run --release -- --size 50 --budget 16 --seed 12345
# Must complete without hanging, Quick Sort must make progress
```

### T010: Performance Benchmarking
**Command Examples**:
```bash
time cargo run --release -- --size 100
time cargo run --release -- --size 500  
time cargo run --release -- --size 1000
```
**Success Criteria**: All complete within reasonable time, no memory leaks

## Notes
- [V] tasks verify existing implementation works correctly
- [P] tasks measure performance characteristics
- [D] tasks ensure documentation is complete and accurate
- Implementation is complete - focus on validation and polish
- All tests should PASS (not fail like normal TDD)
- Critical path: Contract validation → Integration → Performance/Quality → Polish → Final

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Must verify before task completion*

- [x] All 3 contracts have validation tasks (T001-T003)
- [x] All 5 entities from data-model validated  
- [x] All quickstart scenarios have validation tasks (T005-T009)
- [x] Performance requirements have measurement tasks (T010-T014)
- [x] Each validation task specifies exact success criteria
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different focus areas)
- [x] Critical Quick Sort fix has dedicated validation (T004)

## Expected Outcome
Upon completion of all tasks:
- ✅ All contracts verified as implemented correctly
- ✅ All performance targets confirmed met
- ✅ All user scenarios validated working
- ✅ Production readiness confirmed  
- ✅ Documentation complete and accurate

The Sorting Race implementation will be fully validated and production-ready.
